Laptop Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a machine learning-based solution for predicting laptop prices using a dataset of laptop specifications. By leveraging RandomForestRegressor, a powerful ensemble learning method, this model provides reliable price predictions based on various input features such as brand, RAM, storage type, processor, GPU, and more.

Features

Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor, a versatile algorithm known for its ability to handle large datasets and deliver accurate results by averaging multiple decision trees.

Dataset: A dataset containing various laptop specifications (e.g., brand, processor, RAM, storage) and their corresponding prices.

Preprocessing: Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.

Model Evaluation: The model was evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and R2 score to assess its performance on the test data.

Results:

The model successfully predicts laptop prices with high accuracy. The Random Forest algorithmâ€™s robustness ensures reliable predictions even with a diverse range of laptop specifications.
